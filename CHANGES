Fluxus : (C) 2005 Dave Griffiths : dave at pawfal dot org : www.pawfal.org

0.10

* scheme repl (read evaluate print loop) interpreter on ctrl 0
* new cursor
* major overhaul for guile 1.8
* (every frame) now takes a function directly rather than a string
* livecode + osc input recorder for recording and rerendering performances
* (get-projection-transform) gets the projection matrix
* (get-screen-size) returns the resolution as a two value vector
* (set-screen-size (vector x y)) sets the res, and updates the window to match
* support for executable scripts with #!/usr/local/bin/fluxus -x
* grab stack implemented
* (maim) fixed
* (edit) works from the local path again, but searches the searchpaths
first. all script loading uses guile's %load-path, while textures use the
fluxus searchpath, needs unifying maybe and documenting.
* (osc-source) can change port. seems to fail if you set it back to one
used previously, not sure why this is, looking into it. should also be
more stable than before.
* sincos lookup table disabled - was causing "jitteryness" due to lack of
precision in some cases (and it wasn't really helping out speed wise)
* (qaxisangle) : builds a quat with a rotation axis and angle in degrees
* (qmul) : returns two quats multiplied
* (qnormalise) : returns the normalised quat
* (qtomatrix) : returns the rotation matrix for the quaternion
* (build-pixels width height) makes a new pixel primitive
* (upload-pixels) uploads texture data, you need to call this when you've 
finished writing to the pixelprim, and while it's grabbed
* (pixels->texture pixelprim) returns a texture you can use exactly like a 
normal loaded one 
* (camera-lag amount) when locked to a primitive, lags the camera - does
a linear interpolation on the matrix, so you can get some wacky stuff
happening with rotations/scales. smaller numbers are more laggy
* (set-camera-transform) overrides and turns off the mouse camera control - use 
(reset-camera) to switch mouse control back on
* a multiply pdata-op for colour pdata and single float values
* stricter typing - primitive type/exact used where required
* infinite asteroids example

0.9

* (recalc-normals smooth) now takes an optional smooth flag
* osc fix
* blur works for coloured backgrounds
* (searchpath '("path/to/textures" "path/to/scripts" "path/to/scripts2" "path/to/etc"))
* ctrl-x with no selection no longer eats random bits of your script!
* characters not supported by the editor are now represented by yellow blocks, rather than
troublesome invisible entities
* decent camera rotation control with left mouse
* delete/backspace switched for the mac build
* (osc-msg) now stores all messages in a fifo
* (wire-colour colour)
* hide mouse on ctrl m
* locators for all the joints on (show-axis 1)
* (build-fixedjoint obj)
* rotations work with the physics system properly now
* (turtle-push) (turtle-pop) turtle state stack
* (hint-vertcols)
* (get-transform) when not used between a (grab) and (ungrab) this returns the 
current transform from the stack
* save with text highlighted now safe (saves all rather than selection)
* (full-path) searches the searchpaths and returns a fullpath, or the filename 
if not found
* (hint-box) renders object bounding box
* (clip front back) sets the clipping plane positions, defaults to 1 10000
* (frustum top bottom left right) sets screen area, defaults to -0.75 0.75 -1 1
* (hint-multitex) turns on multitexturing
* (multitexture n texture) loads a texture into multitexture slot n.
* orthographic fixes - mouse zoom works, editor projection fixed



0.8

* fixed object picking (mouse-over)
* framedump 
    * memory leak fixed
    * outputs jpg files rather than tiff
    * uses 6 character frame no filenames (so we can save over 6 minutes
of animation :)
* no more portaudio! fluxus now uses jack directly. 
* (smoothing-bias) a kind of weighted average for the harmonic bands
which smooth them out over time. this setting was hardcoded before (to
1.5) but the best setting really depends on the quality of the music,
and ranges from 0 -> 2. it's obvious if you give it a try with the
bars.scm script
* (oscsend) now takes a type string, so you can differenciate between
floats and ints in a message
* (has-collided) returns true if the currently grabbed object collided
with another object in the last update
* (pdata-op "operator" a b) a one call operator for pdata - performs
operation on all values in the pdata array at once. speeds up rendering
of a particle system of 5000 particles from 20fps (looping through each
particle in scheme the old way), to running at 60fps using pdata-op on
my old laptop.
* (grab)/(ungrab) fixed properly - calling (push) or (pop) when an
object is grabbed will cause it to be ungrabbed and print a warning
* polys can be now be rendered in wireframe only (seems this wasn't
working before)
* (fog colour density start end) sets global fog (density to 0 to
disable)
* (selectable bool) whether an object is selectable by (mouse-over)
* (blend-mode src dest)
* (force-load-texture texturefilename)
* (build-seg-plane) takes x,y tesselation values and builds a poly plane
* added a new mode to the particle primitive so you can render textured
sprites (I'll be expanding it a little more to allow different sized
sprites etc)
* (recalc-normals) works for polygons, and smoothes the normals
* lots of fixes to the editor
* some misc bugs fixes with gl state
* html documentation with pics (cheers to Nik for helping out)

nurbs objects
(hide)
(draw-instance)
(get-camera-transform)
