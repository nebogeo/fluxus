<h1>1.0  Introduction </h1>
Fluxus allows you to write Scheme scripts that create graphics live, 
interpreting audio and OSC input as a source of animation data. Fluxus also 
uses a fully featured physics library, which means you can script physical 
properties into objects and simulate them in realtime. Released for Linux under 
the GPL licence.

The built in scheme code editor runs on top of the renderer, which means you 
can edit the scripts while they are running. This allows Fluxus to be used for 
livecoding performances, or simply as a fast feedback way of experimenting or 
learning about graphics and animation.

Fluxus lends itself to procedural modelling and animation, there is no model 
import functionality, only simple primitives. There is an expermental 
procedural modelling tool however, and full support for texturing and basic 
material  properties.
