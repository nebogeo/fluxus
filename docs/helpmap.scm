If\n do-logging is true it outputs a log text file to the current directory for debugging.\n Example: (self-test #t)\n EndFunctionDoc\n StartFunctionDoc-pt\n self-test faz-logar\n Retorna: void\n Descrição:\n Roda todas as funções de referencia nos fluxus em um thread\n separado de forma que você possa ver acontecendo. Apenas checa por\n erros sintáticos em scheme, mudanças nas assinaturas das funçoes\n C++ ligadas e crashes.\n Código gráfico é difícil de testar por correção além (essa é nossa\n desculpa). Se faz-logar for verdadeiro um arquivo texto de log é\n escrito no diretório atual para debugging.\n Exemplo: (self-test #t)\n EndFunctionDoc\n(define (self-test log)\n  (set! do-log log)\n  (thread go))\n\n StartFunctionDoc-en\n run-scripts path-to-examples seconds-per-script\n Returns: void\n Description:\n Runs all of the example scripts in a separate\n thread so you can watch it in action.\n Example: (run-scripts path-to-scripts seconds-per-script)\n EndFunctionDoc\n StartFunctionDoc-pt\n run-scripts caminho-para-exemplos segundos-por-script\n Retorna: void\n Descrição:\n Roda todos os scripts de exemplo em um thread separado para você\n poder assistir.\n Exemplo: (run-scripts path-to-scripts seconds-per-script)\n EndFunctionDoc\n(define example \"\")\n(define run-time 5)\n(define examples-path \"\")\n\n(define (run-example)\n    (load (string-append examples-path example)))\n\n(define (run-all)\n    (for-each\n        (lambda (filename)\n            (let* ((filename (path->string filename))\n                    (len (string-length filename)))\n\n                (when (and (> len 4) (string=? \".scm\" (substring filename (- len 4) len)))\n                    (printf \"~a~n\" filename)\n                    (set! example filename)\n          (clear)\n          (reset-camera)\n                    (let ((thr (thread run-example)))\n                        (sleep run-time)\n                        (kill-thread thr)\n                        (clear))\n                    )))\n        (directory-list examples-path)))\n\n(define (run-scripts path time)\n   (set! examples-path path)\n   (set! run-time time)\n   (thread run-all))\n" ())))))
