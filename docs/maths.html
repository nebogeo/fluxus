<h1>9.0  Maths calls</h1>
For some operations, basic 3D types such as vectors (scheme vectors of size 3) 
and matrices (scheme vectors of size 16) will have to be processed and 
calculations operated on them. There is a basic maths library built into 
fluxus to do this for you.

<c>(vadd v v)
(vsub v v)
(vmul v number)
(vdiv v number)</c>
simple operations on vectors

<c>(vtransform v m)</c>
transform the vector by the matrix m

<c>(vtransform-rot v m)</c>
transform the vector by the matrix m, ignoring the translation part (useful for 
normals)

<c>(vnormalise v)</c>
return a normalised version of vector v

<c>(vdot v v)</c>
returns the dot product from the two vectors

<c>(vmag v)</c>
returns the magnitude of the vector 

<c>(vdist v v)</c>
returns the distance between the two vectors - treated as points

<c>(vcross v v)</c>
returns the cross product vector of the two input vectors

<c>(madd m m)
(msub m m)
(mmul m m)
(mdiv m m)</c>
simple operations on matrices

<c>(mident)</c>
returns the identity matrix

<c>(mtranslate v)</c>
returns a translation matrix 

<c>(mrotate v)</c>
returns a rotation matrix 

<c>(mscale v)</c>
returns a scale matrix 

<c>(mtranspose m)</c>
returns a transposed version of the input matrix (columns = rows)

<c>(minverse m)</c>
returns the inverted version of the input matrix, if it can't be inverted it 
will return the identity matrix (I think)

<c>(maim v v)</c>
returns a matrix aimed down the first vector, using the second vector as the 
up vector. may be buggy.

the following functions return the transform matrices for primitives and the 
camera. these are really useful for a number of tasks, eg to get the position
of a transformed object, use something like:
<c>(grab myobject)
(define position (vtransform (vector 0 0 0) (get-transform)))
(ungrab)</c>

<c>(get-transform)</c>
gets the transform matrix of the grabbed primitive, or the top of the transform 
stack if no object is grabbed

<c>(get-camera-transform)</c>
gets the current camera transform matrix
